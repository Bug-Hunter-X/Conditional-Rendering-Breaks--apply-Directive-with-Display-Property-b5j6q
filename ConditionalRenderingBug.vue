This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a utility class that modifies the `display` property, such as `flex` or `block`, inside of a component.  When the component is conditionally rendered (e.g., using `v-if` in Vue or similar conditional rendering logic), Tailwind's `@apply` directive may not apply the changes correctly, leading to unexpected visual results or layout issues. The element might not render, or it might inherit styles from a parent element that clash with the intended `@apply` styles.
